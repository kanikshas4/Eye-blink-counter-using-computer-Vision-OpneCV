# Eye-blink-counter-using-computer-Vision-OpneCV
Detecting Eye blinking rate in real time using computer vision OpenCV  
It is a part of my Research project that is to detect the factors causing Computer vision syndrome. so, this programme First detects number of Blinks 
and adds it to the blink counter created. Along with it there is a timer attached that shows the real time for which the video is captured in OpenCV frame.
Then as a preventive mausure raises an alert if the blink counter is less than 12 and the timer is more than 60 seconds.
